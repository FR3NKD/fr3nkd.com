We went from personal websites, blogs, and forums to centralized platforms, algorithms, ads, and corporations. 

**I miss the old internet.**

As a kid, I was amazed by the web. I could talk to people from all over the world, learn new things, play games, watch videos, and listen to music, it was magical.

Now, it’s all about private platforms whose only goal is to make money by keeping you endlessly scrolling.

But it's not all lost! We are seeing the rise of the "[indie web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUgOT22F5s)" where people are creating their own websites and blogs again. It's a small movement, but it's growing.

I think it's important to have a place online that you actually own. A space where you can share your thoughts and ideas without worrying about algorithms or corporate oversight. 

That's why I created this website. It's a place where I can share my ideas with the world, and most importantly, a place where I can just be myself.
