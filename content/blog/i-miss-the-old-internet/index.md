We went from personal websites, blogs and forums to centralized platforms like X, Instagram and TikTok.

I miss the old internet...

As a kid d I was amazed by the internet. I could talk to people from all over the world, I could learn new things, I could play games, I could watch videos, I could listen to music, I could do so many things. It was a magical.

Now it's all about algorithms, ads and corporations.

But its not all lost! We are seeing the rise of this idea of "indie web" where people are creating their own websites and blogs again. Its a small movement but its growing.

I think its important to have a place online that you own. A place where you can share your thoughts and ideas without worrying about algorithms or corporations. A place where you can be yourself.

Thats why I created this website. A place where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world. A place where I can be myself.
