I could talk to people from all over the world, learn new things, play games, watch videos, listen to music, do so many things. It was magical.\nNow it’s all about private platforms with the only goal of making money by keeping you scrolling endlessly.\nBut its not all lost! We are seeing the rise of this idea of “indie web” where people are creating their own websites and blogs again. Its a small movement but its growing.\nI think its important to have a place online that you own. A place where you can share your thoughts and ideas without worrying about algorithms or corporations.\nThats why I created this website. A place where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world. A place where I can be myself."},"title":"I miss the old internet..."},"/glossary":{"data":{},"title":"Glossary"}}
