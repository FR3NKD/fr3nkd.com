I could talk to people from all over the world, I could learn new things, I could play games, I could watch videos, I could listen to music, I could do so many things. It was a magical.\nNow it’s all about algorithms, ads and corporations.\nBut its not all lost! We are seeing the rise of this idea of “indie web” where people are creating their own websites and blogs again. Its a small movement but its growing.\nI think its important to have a place online that you own. A place where you can share your thoughts and ideas without worrying about algorithms or corporations. A place where you can be yourself.\nThats why I created this website. A place where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world. A place where I can be myself."},"title":"I miss the old internet..."},"/glossary":{"data":{},"title":"Glossary"}}
