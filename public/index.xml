&lt;p&gt;We went from personal websites, blogs and forums to centralized platforms, algorithms, ads and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss the old internet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid I was amazed by the internet. I could talk to people from all over the world, learn new things, play games, watch videos, listen to music, do so many things. It was magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s all about private platforms with the only goal of making money by keeping you scrolling endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its not all lost! We are seeing the rise of this idea of the &amp;ldquo;indie web&amp;rdquo; where people are creating their own websites and blogs again. Its a small movement but its growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think its important to have a place online that you own. A place where you can share your thoughts and ideas without worrying about algorithms or corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats why I created this website. A place where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world. A place where I can be myself.&lt;/p&gt;
